# ESP32 Embedded Systems

This directory contains code and resources specifically for ESP32 microcontroller development within the NeuroFlux project.

## Swarm Communication

`swarm_communication.cpp` includes the initial setup for multi-modal (WiFi, LoRa, Bluetooth Mesh) communication among ESP32 devices, forming a swarm that can exchange "digital pheromones."

### Building and Deployment
Code in this directory is intended for use with ESP32 development frameworks such as:
- PlatformIO
- ESP-IDF (Espressif IoT Development Framework)
- Arduino Core for ESP32

Further build instructions and project configuration files (e.g., `platformio.ini`) would be added here as development progresses.
