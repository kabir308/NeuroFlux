# NeuroFlux Models

This repository contains the trained models and configurations for the NeuroFlux framework.

## Available Models

- `neuroflux/tinybert`: A tiny version of BERT optimized for microscopic AI
- `neuroflux/mobilenet`: A lightweight MobileNet for computer vision tasks
- `neuroflux/emotion-detector`: A specialized model for emotion detection

## Usage

To use these models with the NeuroFlux framework:

```python
from neuroflux.models import NanoModel

model = NanoModel.from_pretrained("neuroflux/tinybert")
```

## Model Cards

Each model has its own model card with detailed information:

- [TinyBERT Model Card](models/tinybert/README.md)
- [MobileNet Model Card](models/mobilenet/README.md)
- [Emotion Detector Model Card](models/emotion-detector/README.md)
